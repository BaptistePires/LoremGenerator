This Sublime Text package allows you to generat lorem text randomly from 1 to 500 words. It works with Sublime Text's auto-completion.

From "lo" to "lorem" typed, it will generates 25 words.

The allowed range is 0 to 500. More than 500 will generates 500 words.

It's easy to use, there is an example :
