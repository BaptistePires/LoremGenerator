# LoremGenerator
This Sublime Text packahe allows you to generat lorem text randomly from 1 to 500 words.

It's easy to use, there is an example :

First, you can type just "lo" and it will insert you 25 words, it's the default 
number of words if you don't specify one. 

If you type "lorem2" then press CTRL + SPACE for the auto-completion, it will
generate your lorem.

The allowed range starts from 0 to 500. If you type "lorem0", it will insert 1 word.
